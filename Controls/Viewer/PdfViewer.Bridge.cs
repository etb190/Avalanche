    /// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. PdfViewer.Viewport.cs and PdfViewer.Zoom.cs were moved across VERBATIM -
    /// roughly 2,100 lines carrying about 700 references to window members spelled bare (PageList,
    /// _doc, Loc, RenderAllAnnotations...). Rewriting those 700 sites in the same change that moved
    /// the files would have been unreviewable. Declaring the names here instead means the moved
    /// files did not change a character of logic, and the entire coupling surface between viewer
    /// and window is one readable list.
    ///
    /// THIS IS SCAFFOLDING, NOT THE DESTINATION. Read the groups below as a to-do list:
    ///   - Group B is per-DOCUMENT state that belongs in DocumentSession. When the viewer holds
    ///     its own active session, that block deletes itself.
    ///   - Group C members live in files that have not moved into the viewer. Each deletes itself
    ///     as its defining file arrives; the defining file is named against every one.
    ///   - Group A is the only group meant to survive, and it should end up expressed as
    ///     IViewerHost rather than as raw Owner reach.
    ///
    /// Host is null only between construction and the window wiring it up, which happens in the
    /// MainWindow constructor before any of this can run. The null-forgiving operator is therefore
    /// deliberate: a null here is a wiring bug and should throw loudly, not render nothing.
