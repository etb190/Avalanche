    // This pane's tab band: which tabs are in the strip, which of them owns an edge, what the card's
    // top corners do, where the focus ring runs, and the drag that reorders them or hands one to the
    // other pane.
    //
    // Ported from KillerShell (FilePane.xaml + Tabs.cs + DualPane.cs + PaneDrag.cs). The strip is an
    // ItemsControl bound to _sessions over a UniformGrid in a bounded host, and every visual decision below is a
    // NOTIFYING FLAG ON THE SESSION that a template trigger reads - not a property written onto a
    // code-built Border. That is the whole point: there is one place each rule is expressed, so a
    // fix to one edge case cannot break the next one.
    //
    // Two consequences worth knowing before changing anything here:
    //   * UniformGrid divides the bounded host equally. The host grows only until the tabs reach
    //     their maximum width, so a few tabs do not stretch across the whole pane.
    //   * A collapsed child is not counted when UniformGrid divides the band, so windowing tabs out
    //     into the chevron needs no width arithmetic at all - the survivors fill the band on their own.
