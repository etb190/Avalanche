// ============================================================
// SHARED FADE / SLIDE
//
// One place for the timing and easing every surface animates with, so the main window, the
// dialogs, the overlays and the rail flyouts all appear the same way. An app that hand-rolls a
// DoubleAnimation per call site ends up with four durations and three easings, which reads as
// four different products.
//
// THIS IS THE CANONICAL COPY (consolidated 2026-08-08). Every app carries a byte-identical
// copy of this file - only the namespace line differs - so a diff against this file IS the
// drift check. It replaced five copies that had each grown a different subset: the kit shipped
// no fade-out at all, so KillerNotes invented FadeOutAndClose and KillerPDF invented
// FadeOut(element, done) independently, while KillerScan, KillerShell and Killendar closed
// every dialog with no fade. When something here needs to change, change it HERE first, then
// re-copy into every app.
//
// COPY THIS FILE INTO THE APP and change the namespace - it is a plain static helper with no
// dependencies. Usage:
//
//     Loaded += (_, _) => Anim.FadeIn(RootBorder);      // a dialog, on its root Border
//     Anim.SlideInX(flyout, -12);                       // a rail flyout, gliding out of the rail
//
// The dialog's root Border must start at Opacity="0" in XAML, or the first frame paints solid
// before the animation takes over and the fade is a flicker rather than a fade.
//
// Two fade-outs, for two shapes of close:
//   - FadeOutAndClose(window, ref flag): call from an OnClosing override; it cancels that close,
//     fades the whole window, then closes for real. The default for a Window.
//   - FadeOut(element, done): fades a named element and runs a callback. For a dialog that must
//     hold its DialogResult until after the fade: assigning DialogResult is itself a close
//     request, and WPF resets DialogResult to null whenever a close is canceled, so such a
//     dialog records the result, fades, and assigns it in the callback (see KillerPDF's
//     FileDialog.OnClosing).
